# Bad FL

This project is an encapsulation of some common components, aiming to decouple the project and improve portability.

We classify components into the following categories:

- `impl`: Utils' implementations (request, etc.)
- `wrapper`: Non-rendering components (event listeners, etc.)
- `prefab`: Minimum-level components (buttons, input boxes, etc.)
- `layout`: Larger-level components (navigation bar, etc.)
- `scaffold`: Page-level components (carousel, etc.)

## TODOs

- A playground for dynamically configuring components' props with real-time preview
