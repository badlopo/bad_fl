# BadFL

[![Pub Version](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/bad_fl)](https://github.com/badlopo/bad_fl)

A flutter package, including components, implementations, helper functions and extensions. Designed to provide a simple
way to develop with flutter.

## Overview

The [`bad_fl`](https://pub.dev/packages/bad_fl) expresses component properties in a form closer to CSS representation,
making it easier for web developers to get started.

**NOTE:** This library **completely** abandons semantics! (For example, `Container`+`GestureDetector` is used to
express a `Button` rather than build-in ones) People who have related needs or care about this should use it with
caution.
